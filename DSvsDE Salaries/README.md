Background

You work for an international HR consultancy helping companies attract and retain top talent in the competitive tech industry. As part of your services, you provide clients with insights into industry salary trends to ensure they remain competitive in hiring and compensation practices. Your team wants to use a data-driven approach to analyse how various factors—such as job role, experience level, remote work, and company size—impact salaries globally. By understanding these trends, you can advise clients on offering competitive packages to attract the best talent. In this competition, you’ll explore and visualise salary data from thousands of employees worldwide. If you're tackling the advanced level, you'll go a step further — building predictive models to uncover key salary drivers and providing insights on how to enhance future data collection.

    How many records are in the dataset, and what is the range of years covered?
    What is the average salary (in USD) for Data Scientists and Data Engineers? Which role earns more on average?
    How many full-time employees based in the US work 100% remotely?
